# Hi! I am Chris Yoon

I am a first year undergraduate at Columbia University (Class of 2024), where I plan to study Mathematics. 

Currently, I am interested in the theory and applications of reinforcement learning (RL). In the near future, I would also like to study more about optimization, distributed computing and robotics. 

For more information, here is [my resume](https://cyoon1729.github.io/resume_0820.pdf) (up-to-date as of August 2020).
